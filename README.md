# Monster Farm
A proof of concept for a game centering around breeding monsters. By Nicholas Fletcher. All Rights Reserved (for now).

### Main Storage:
In Main Storage, you can inspect your monsters to view their genes, renaming or selling them. You can also buy new monsters from the main storage menu.

### Breeding Cavern:
The beating heart of any monster farm, sending two monsters into the caverns allows you to breed them, resulting in three coming out. The new monster will be a combination of the genes of the two parents, along with a few new random genes. Be careful about the genes shown in brackets: if the parents have matching ones, the offspring will be weakened.

### The Performance Stage:
The main use for your monsters, putting them on stage to put on a show. Once you have monsters on stage, you can hold a show and select a stat for them to show off. Up to two monsters can be on stage at once. Monsters who are closely related can work together to put on a better show.

### The Mystic Pool:
By sending a monster into the pool and paying a small fee, you can improve one of their stats. However, one of their other stats at random will be reduced. Specifically, one of their genes in the target stat will be swapped with a higher gene in any other stat. There are also sometimes... side effects, which may be positive or negative.

### The Records Room:
In the records room, you can check which trophies you have earned. You can also save and close the game.
